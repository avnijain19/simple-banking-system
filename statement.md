## 🔹 Introduction
The Simple Banking System is a console-based application created using Java programming.  
The purpose of this project is to simulate basic banking activities such as depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the available balance.  
The project uses Object-Oriented Programming concepts and menu-based program design to offer a smooth user experience.

## 🔹 Problem Statement
In real life, banking systems handle multiple complex operations.  
However, for learning purposes, students require a small and simple system that demonstrates the basic functioning of a bank account.  
This project solves that need by providing a basic model where the user can perform simple financial operations in a structured programming environment.

## 🔹 Project Objectives
The main objectives are:
- To design a simple system that performs essential banking operations.
- To implement Java classes and objects for real-world problem modeling.
- To understand control structures, loops, and user input handling.
- To create a clean and user-friendly menu-based application.
- To follow a modular and structured programming approach.

## 🔹 Project Scope
The project covers:
- One user account  
- Deposit, Withdraw, and Check Balance operations  
- Console interface  
- Basic validation for inputs  

The project does **not** include:
- Multiple accounts  
- Online system  
- Databases  
- GUI or advanced security  

This keeps the project simple and focused on the basics.

## 🔹 Modules in the System

### ✔ Deposit Module  
Allows the user to enter an amount which is then added to the balance.

### ✔ Withdraw Module  
Subtracts a valid amount from the account balance.  
If the balance is insufficient, it shows an error.

### ✔ Balance Check Module  
Displays the current value stored in the account balance.

### ✔ Exit Module  
Stops the program safely when the user chooses to exit.

## 🔹 Expected Output
The system displays a clear menu and performs actions based on input.  
The user receives appropriate messages for success, errors, invalid options, and balance updates.

## 🔹 Conclusion
The Simple Banking System is an easy-to-understand yet effective Java mini-project.  
It demonstrates how basic banking operations can be implemented using fundamental programming concepts.  
The project helps build confidence for beginners and acts as a foundation for developing larger Java applications in the future.
