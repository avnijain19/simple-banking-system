This project demonstrates how a basic banking system works behind the scenes. It simulates a bank account where users can deposit money, withdraw funds, and check their balance using a simple console menu.

The project was developed to explore how banking operations can be implemented in Java. It also provides hands-on experience with important programming concepts such as classes, methods, object-oriented design, loops, conditional statements, and user interaction through the console.

##  What Can This Banking System Do?

- **Deposit Money:**  
  Add money to your account and instantly update the balance.

- **Withdraw Money:**  
  Need cash? Withdraw any amount, and the system checks whether your balance is enough before allowing it.

- **Check Balance:**  
  View your current account balance anytime you want.

- **Menu-Based Navigation:**  
  Choose actions easily from a simple menu that keeps repeating until you decide to exit.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Prevents negative deposits, invalid choices, and incorrect withdrawals.

This project isn’t about advanced features—it’s about learning how real-world ideas can be converted into programs using simple building blocks.
